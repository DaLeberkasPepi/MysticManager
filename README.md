# MysticManager 
This script is written in the Language `AutoHotkey`. The main purpose of this script is to make it possible to reroll items at the Mystic automatically.

## Usage

* If you want to roll for prefined stats just select the wanted stat in the dropdown-menu [1.].
* If you want to roll for a stat that is not listed in the dropdown-menu e.g. skill dmg just type the stat in the [2.] edit field.
* **Important!!!:** Only [1.] OR [2.] may contain a stat. Not both at the same time!
* In the [3.] edit field you can type in at which roll of the given stat the script should stop rerolling. The rule for this is that it has to be equal or higher than the number you've typed into the edit field.

Before you start the script you have to make sure that you've already selected the stat you want to reroll. It should look like this:
